## Origins of Democracy: An Ongoing Debate

### Introduction

Why are some states democratic while others are authoritarian? Comparative political scientists have been trying to answer this question for as long as the field has existed. The factors commonly used to explain the emergence and persistence of democracy fit into one of three categories: institutional factors, cultural factors, and economic factors. In this report, I will broadly explore facets from each of these areas and how they relate with the health of democracy. While this report analyzes these relationships at the global level, I also generated individualized country reports for every country for which data was available. These can be found in the *reports* folder of the project. 

I proceed by broadly describing the data I will be using throughout the report. I then turn to exploring the relationship of GDP, GDP per capita, and GINI coefficients with democracy. Next, I look at the correlation between literacy rates and democracy scores. Finally, I examine the proportion of women in national legislatures alongside democracy scores. 

## Data Sources

To operationalize democratic quality, I downloaded the [FreedomHouse Country & Territory Ratings](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world). The dataset has measurements of 206 country's political rights and civil liberties since 1973. FreedomHouse variables use a non-intuitive coding scheme where higher ratings indicate less democratic qualities and lower ratings indicate more. Therefore, I have recoded all variables so that low ratings correspond to low democracy indicators, and high ratings with high democracy indicators. Thus, the `political rights` variable ranges from 1-7, with lower scores indicating unfair or non-existant electoral processes, unaccountable officials, closed political systems, etc. Likewise, the `civil liberties` variable ranges from 1-7 and covers a wide metric of individual freedoms, like: free religious expression, protection for labor organization, due process rights, property guarantees, etc. I combine these scores into an overall *democracy* rating, `demscore`, which ranges from 2-14.

FreedomHouse generally considers countries to be "free" when they have both high civil liberty scores **and** high political rights scores. The below chart highlights the rough idea, although it's outdated by current metrics since the scores no longer range to 40 and 60.

All other substantive data, including GDP, literacy rates, and proportion of women in legislatures, comes from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator). These metrics are straightforward, so I will refrain from explaining them here.  

Lastly, I imported a [basic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region?resource=download) that just assigns every country its proper continent and region in the world, since these may be useful for breaking up the global analysis into more digestible chunks. 

## Democracy and GDP, GDP per capita, and GINI Scores

```{r Democracy x Economics}


ggplot(data = fh_wb,
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdp)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP Globally",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000000000000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-12, prefix = "$", suffix = "t", accuracy = 1))



```

From a first cut look at the data on democracy scores and GDP, there doesn't appear to be a strong relationship at first glance, with most observations having very low GDPs. However, this is a bad representation of the relationship because it does not account for the wide variation in GDP - particularly over time. The median GDP for all countries at all time periods covered is `r median(fh_wb$gdp, na.rm=TRUE)` - notably smaller than the mean GDP of `r mean(fh_wb$gdp, na.rm=TRUE)`. I attempt to account for this by lowering the maximum scale of the graph to $50 billion and breaking the analysis into decades. 

```{r Dem x Econ by Decade}



ggplot(data = fh_wb,
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdp)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP Globally by Decade",
            subtitle = "1970s-2010s",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50000000000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-9, prefix = "$", suffix = "b", accuracy = 1)) +
       facet_wrap(~ decade)

```

This graph yields interesting results: the relationship between democracy and GDP seems to vary over time, with a potentially positive relaitonship in the 70s and 80s, but a more ambivalent or negative relationship in the 2000s and 2010s. Because some effects still may be confounded by time, I select a single year (the most recent in the dataset) to examine the relationship. 

```{r Dem x Econ 2019}
fh_wb %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdp)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP Globally",
            subtitle = "2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50000000000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-9, prefix = "$", suffix = "b", accuracy = 1))
```


The trend becomes more clear, although it is unexpected and contrasts with the expectation that richer countries will have higher democracy scores. Because GDP may not be the best measurement of the health and development of a country's economy, I turn to GDP per Capita next. 


```{r Dem x GDP per Capita}

ggplot(data = fh_wb,
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdppc)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP per Capita Globally",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP per Capita") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 60000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-3, prefix = "$", suffix = "k", accuracy = 1)) +
       facet_wrap(~ decade)


fh_wb %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdppc)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP per Capita Globally",
            subtitle = "2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP per Capita") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 60000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-3, prefix = "$", suffix = "k", accuracy = 1))

```

While the relationship seems more foundationally positive now - at least at the extremes, the regression lines are still mostly flat. Essentially, it looks like that there's a lot of poorer countries spread across the lower democracy scores, not in any particularly linear fashion.  

As a final potential factor interacting with GDP, I examine the impact of a country's geo-location. 


```{r Dem x GDP per Capita by Continent}


fh_wb %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>%
  drop_na(demscore, gdppc, continent) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gdppc, color = continent)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth(alpha = 0.1) + 
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and GDP per Capita by Continent",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GDP per Capita") +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 60000),
                    labels  = label_number(scale = 1e-3, prefix = "$", suffix = "k", accuracy = 1))
```

While the relationship remains inherently flat for most democracy scores, it seems clear that there is a relationship between continent and democracy score, as well as GDP per Capita. Specifically, countries in Europe seem to have both high democracy scores and GDP per Capitas, on average. Likewise, the regression line for Africa predicts GDP per capitas to be below $10k even for the highest democracy ratings, whereas those for Europe are predicted around $40k for the highest democracy rating. 

To conclude the section on economic relationships, I examine the relationship between democracy and inequality. 

```{r Dem x Inequality}
fh_wb %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gini)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Inequality Globally",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GINI Coefficient") 

fh_wb %>%
  drop_na(continent) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = gini, color = continent)) + 
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth(alpha = 0.1) +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Inequality by Continent",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "GINI Coefficient") 
```

The smooth line shows what seems to be either a positive or inverse-u shaped trend, consistent with findings from Acemoglu and Robinson (2005), who theorize that particularly low or high levels of inequality are bad for democracy. At low levels, they argue that citizens are not sufficiently incentivized to disrupt the status quo of authoritarian politics, and at high levels, they argue the political elite have economic reasons to suppress democratic reformers. At middling levels, as seen in the graph where inequality spikes with democracy, there is just enough incentive for citizens to revolt and elites to grant concessions in the form of democratic institutions.  

The continents scatterplot highlights general trends in inequality: Of democracies, those in the Americas seem more likely to have higher inequality, while those in Europe seem more likely to have less. Countries in Asia seem more likely to have lower levels of inequality as well as low democracy ratings. 

## Democracy and Literacy Rates

```{r Dem x Literacy Rates}

ggplot(data = fh_wb,
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = litrate)) +
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Literacy Rates Globally",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "Literacy Rates") 

```

The global relationship between literacy rates and democracy appears to be rather static and unnoticeable for more autocratic countries, but when democracy scores improve beyond roughly 7, higher literacy rates start to coincide with higher levels of democracy, on average. In other words, whether a relationship exists may depend on the current level of democracy in a given country. We can also look at this relationship across continents. 

```{r Dem x Literacy Rates by Continent}

fh_wb %>%
  drop_na(continent) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = litrate, color = continent)) +
       geom_point() +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Literacy Rates by Continent",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "Literacy Rates") 


```

The scatterplot highlights some interesting trends: countries in Asia are notably clustered in the upper left quadrant, which is countries with high literacy scores **and** low democracy ratings. Why are Asian countries specifically apparently likely to fall into this category? Future research could examine this. Countries in the Americas are roughly centered in the upper right quadrant: with high literacy rates and high democracy scores. Most countries squarely in the lower quadrants (indicating low literacy rates) are countries in Africa. 


## Democracy and Women in Legislatures
```{r Dem x Women in Legislatures}

ggplot(data = fh_wb,
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = womenleg)) +
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Proportion of Women in Legislatures Globally",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "% of Women in Legislature") 


fh_wb %>%
  drop_na(decade, demscore, womenleg) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = womenleg)) +
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth() +
       facet_wrap(~ decade) +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Proportion of Women in Legislatures Globally by Decade",
            subtitle = "1970s-2010s",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "% of Women in Legislature")

fh_wb %>%
  drop_na(continent, decade, demscore, womenleg) %>%
ggplot(
       mapping = aes(x = demscore, y = womenleg, color = continent)) +
       geom_point() +
       facet_wrap(~ decade) +
       labs(title = "Democracy Score and Proportion of Women in Legislatures Globally by Decade and Continent",
            subtitle = "1973-2019",
            x = "Democracy Score",
            y = "% of Women in Legislature")

```

The figures over time highlight that the proportion of women in legislatures has increased over time for *all* regime types - not just democracies. Thus, it may not be a reliable indicator of whether or not a country is becoming more democratic. Still, the regression lines show a generally positive trend, and countries in - for instance - Europe, have both a notably higher democracy score *and* proportion of women in their legislatures than countries in - for instance - Asia.


## Future Research
The models show weak but generally expected relationships between the covariates and democracy. Future research should explore these relationships with formal statistical models. Refer to attached country profiles to see each country compares in its democracy ratings as well as how the relationship between income and democracy functions on a country-level basis.
